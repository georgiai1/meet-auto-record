# Privacy Policy for Google Meet Auto Record (Workspace)

**Last Updated:** November 28, 2025

## Overview

Google Meet Auto Record (Workspace) is a browser extension that automatically configures recording settings for Google Meet meetings. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

This extension:
- Does NOT collect any personal information
- Does NOT track your browsing activity
- Does NOT store any meeting content, recordings, or transcripts
- Does NOT communicate with any external servers
- Does NOT use analytics or tracking tools
- Does NOT share any data with third parties

## How the Extension Works

The extension operates entirely within your browser and only on two domains:
- `calendar.google.com` - To configure meeting recording settings
- `meet.google.com` - To automatically start recording when you join meetings

All functionality is performed locally in your browser. The extension simply automates clicking buttons and checkboxes that you would otherwise click manually.

## Permissions Used

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `storage` | Saves extension preferences locally in your browser |
| `activeTab` | Interacts with the current Google Calendar or Meet tab |
| `host_permissions` (calendar.google.com, meet.google.com) | Required to run content scripts that automate recording setup |

## Data Storage

The extension stores minimal data locally in your browser:
- Session flags to prevent duplicate notifications
- No personal data, credentials, or meeting content is ever stored

## Third-Party Services

This extension does not integrate with any third-party services. It only interacts with Google Calendar and Google Meet through your browser.

## Open Source

This extension is open source. You can review the complete source code at:

## Your Google Data

Any recordings, transcripts, or meeting notes created through Google Meet are handled entirely by Google according to their privacy policy. This extension simply enables these Google features automatically - it does not access, process, or store any of that content.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date above and publish the new policy in our GitHub repository.
